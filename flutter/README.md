***Top Carousel***

The idea is to have infinitely scrolling cards, which would contain a card for an upcoming event and the other cards would contain images from previous meetups (currently containing placeholders) or anything for that matter .

***Grid Of Meetups***

This Grid contains upcoming and past meetups marked with a chip / flag (currently not present).

Each card in this grid should contain very ***minimal*** amount to data (Date, Time, Etc). Each card contains a Location Button ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/I5ZuinjXWPdb3Hk_BtWgEnz_5oYzHdxXP1WtdE3Ia2wa4KigzGP1fDy7AZt5OhQPeKKzmg_X5Kk_lGIH8fuRdZLQFPmraF83zxAlT8s6DWFMfgmsnc8ZwGXEvDQJwdcgqkmNCwam) which on clicked takes the user to Google Maps.

The top card would contain basic details about the event.

The Speakers are listed out in this beautiful card like format, the accent color for the speaker (currently red) will be extracted from the image.
If a user on the image of the speaker, the search ui would be shown up and other talks form the speaker would be shown off.

***Google Maps***

This Container shows the location of the meetup.

***The Like / favourite Button***
The like button should add this meetup a list of "favourite" , also the like button should add this meetup to the users calendar!
